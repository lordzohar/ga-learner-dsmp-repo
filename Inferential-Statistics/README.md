### Project Overview

 **Inferential Statistics**

## Problem Statement
Bank Of New York wants to expand its branches and for that, it has a certain hypothesis and statements it wants to verify. Using the inferential statistics method you just learned, help the bank.

- About the Dataset

- link for the dataset is here - https://www.kaggle.com/kennykozak/loan-repayment-prediction
 
- It has data from 9578 customers with the following 15 features:
#### Feature	Description

1. customer.id	ID of the customer
2. credit.policy	If the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com or not
3. purpose	The purpose of the loan(takes values :"creditcard", "debtconsolidation", "educational", "majorpurchase", "smallbusiness", and "all_other").
4. int.rate	The interest rate of the loan
5. installment	The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded
6. log.annual.inc	The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower
7. dti	The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income)
8. fico	The FICO credit score of the borrower
9. days.with.cr.line	The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.
10. revol.bal	The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle)
11. revol.util	The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available)

15. paid.back.loan	Whether the user has paid back loa


### Learnings from the project

 We learn the will apply the following concepts:
•	Confidence Interval
•	Central Limit Theorem
•	Hypothesis Testing
•	Chi-Square Test

### Solviing problems for Banking Inferences
Small Business Interests
- The bank manager believes that people with purpose as 'small_business' have been given int.rate more due to the risk assosciated


### Installment vs Loan Defaulting
- The bank thinks that monthly installments (installment) customers have to pay might have some sort of effect on loan defaulters

### Purpose vs Loan Defaulting
- The banks need to find out the loan defaulter by assuming all the customers are same and calculating the different purposes for loan and comparing with loan repayments based on if loan repayment was done or not.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Assuming Null hypothesis we assume a problem and we perform a hypotheisis testing on the basis of which we accept for reject the null hypotheisis


### Challenges faced

 There were multiple issues like stipping (%) from data converting to float concatinating data frames creating subplots and looping over samples while creating plots.
