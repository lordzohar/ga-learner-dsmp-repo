## Project Overview

 Summarizing data with statistics

## Superhero Statistics
The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 super humans but we need your knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.
