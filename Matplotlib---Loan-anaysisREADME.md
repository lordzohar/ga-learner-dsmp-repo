### Project Overview

 # Visualing Loan Aroval analysis project
It considers the following data points

### Loan Status
Calculates a visual bar graph of loans aree approved or not

-  Company has more 'loan approvals' or 'loan disapprovals'?
-  Can one of the company's health factors be its loan status distribution?


### Everyone needs money

    The company provides financial assistance across the different regions of the country. One interesting statistic that stakeholders want to see is the loan approval distribution across the regions. 

-  Which is the region with the highest no. of loan approvals? lowest no. of loan approvals? 
-  Which is the region with the maximum difference between loan approvals and loan rejections?

### Expensive Education
    Higher education has always been an expensive endeavour for people but it results in better career opportunities and stability in life. But does higher education result in a better guarantee in issuing loans?

-  Overall which group has asked for higher loan services irrespective of the approval? Graduate or Non-Graduate?
-  Which group has had better approval to non-approval ratio? Graduate or Non-Graduate?
-  Do the above conclusions make sense? Why?

### Smarter and Richer?

-   Do Graduate people get approved a higher amount than their Non Graduate counterparts?

-   What's the average amount of loan approved for Graduate? for Non-Graduate? Is there a huge difference between the two? 

### Income vs Loan
    For any financial institution to be successful in its loan lending system, there has to be a correlation between the borrower's income and loan amount he is lent. 

-  Is there a correlation between 'ApplicantIncome' and 'LoanAmount'?(One way to know that is looking at the line formed when you connect the scatter plot dots?)
-  Is the 'TotalIncome' better related to the 'LoanAmount' than 'ApplicantIncome'?


### Learnings from the project

 Matplot lib and pandas plots plots

1. Bar graph
2. Linegraph
3. Density graph
4. Subplots


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Understanding the data and grouing data in proper groups and visualizing them


### Challenges faced

 I faced multiple issues like understanding how subplots work and xticks and rotations and other few visualization things


### Additional pointers

 It's a really great project do take a look
