### Project Overview

## Data Wrangling in pandas

You have been hired by the stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights on the company's operations. Using the data visualization techniques you learned, you have to help visualise the data and see if you can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.
